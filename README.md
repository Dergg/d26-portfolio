## üöÄ Projects

### [**Shortest Vector Problem Estimation**](https://github.com/Dergg/SVP_in_Cpp)
  C++ tool to estimate SVP with LLL-reduction & SE-enumeration | *C++, Makefile*\
  During one of my many university modules, I was given the task of approximating solutions to the Shortest Vector Problem using C++, which, at the time, I was unfamiliar with. My appraoch to this project was to first code my solution in Python, which is a language I'm much more familiar with, then "translating" my code to C++, as Python and C++ can have very similar functionality. This was one of my highest-scoring modules during my second year at university.

### [**Final Year Project ‚Äì Crowdsourced Free-Text Data**](https://github.com/Dergg/VisCogs)  
  Processing & analysis of crowdsourced data | *Python, NLP (spaCy)*\
  During my final year at university, I was tasked with a research project, using the publicly available, crowdsourced Discogs dataset and various natrual language processing (NLP) techniques to extract information about and relationships between entities from free-text data, without the use of artificial intelligence. Using simple pattern matching approaches and spaCy, we were able to identify relationships and entity information with a reasonable level of accuracy. You can find the paper I wrote for this project [here](https://github.com/Dergg/VisCogs/blob/main/Toward_a_new_history_of_the_recording_industry.pdf).

### [**Simulated Synaesthesia**](https://github.com/Dergg/Simulated-Synaesthesia)  
  Music computing algorithm to visualise sound | *Python, Librosa*\
  Another module during my final year at university was an introduction to music computing, giving me insights on how I can use music and musical data in a program, analyse and experiment with it, as well as ways of visualising and exploring the data. We were tasked with an open-ended objective: use musical data to create a program of your choosing. My choice was to create a music data visualisation, with the aims of simulating the feeling of synaesthesia. While I was unable to obtain a representative audience for the survey, the project is one of my proudest from a computing perspective.
